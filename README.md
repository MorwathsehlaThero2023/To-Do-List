# To-Do-List
Add Tasks, Task List, Delete Tasks

For the To-Do List project, I utilized a combination of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create an interactive task management tool. HTML was employed to structure the elements of the list, CSS to style them in a visually appealing manner, and JavaScript to enable dynamic functionality. Users can add, edit, and remove tasks directly on the webpage, and the list updates in real time without requiring a page reload. This seamless interaction was achieved through the use of event listeners and DOM manipulation in JavaScript.
